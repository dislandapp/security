### Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vulnerability, check if it exists already, do your reseach on the internet, and if yes, provide a CVE ID with your report.
If you have a CVE ID:
- Specify affected products as the product used in disland.

If not:
- Add a new affected product for the affected ones (backend, frontend, etc)
  - Specify `@disland` as the ecosystem
  - Fill in the left fields.

If your vulnerability report does not follow these rules or its not clear enough, It will either: Be ignored or fixed silently.
